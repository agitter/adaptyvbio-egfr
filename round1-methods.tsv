gitter-yolo1	BLOSUM62 matrix, manual	From PDB structure 8HGS ('The EGF-bound EGFR ectodomain homodimer') select human EGF (UniProt P01133) and focus on the annotated 53 amino acid sequence from positions 971-1023. Manually modify the first 10 positions using the BLOSUM62 matrix for guidance.
gitter-yolo2	BLOSUM62 matrix, manual	From PDB structure 6ARU ('Structure of Cetuximab Fab mutant in complex with EGFR extracellular domain') select the Cetuximab mutant heavy chain sequence. Select residues far from the binding interface in loops and manually modify them using the BLOSUM62 matrix for guidance. Remove the first 22 residues to satisfy the maximum length restrictions.
gitter-yolo3	ProTrek	Use HuggingFace Spaces to run Demo_ProTrek_650M_UniRef50 with the prompt 'A binding protein to the extracellular domain of EGFR' with the Swiss-Prot database. Select the third result, UniProt Q14677. Identify PDB structure 1XGW for positions 1-165 ('The crystal structure of human enthoprotin N-terminal domain') that satisfies the maximum length restrictions and select that unmodified sequence.
gitter-yolo4	ProTrek	Use HuggingFace Spaces to run Demo_ProTrek_650M_UniRef50 with the prompt 'A binding protein to the extracellular domain of EGFR' with the Uncharacterized database. Select the second result, UniProt A0A6P7EHA0. Select residues 1-159 to prioritize high pLDDT regions in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database structure and satisfy the maximum length restrictions.
gitter-yolo5	ProTrek	Use HuggingFace Spaces to run Demo_ProTrek_650M_UniRef50 with the prompt 'A binding protein to the extracellular domain of EGFR' with the Uncharacterized database. Select the fourth result, UniProt A0A8C6JZL0. No AlphaFold Protein Structure Database structure available so run AlphaFold3 through https://alphafoldserver.com/. Select residues 1-150 to prioritize high pLDDT regions and satisfy the maximum length restrictions.
