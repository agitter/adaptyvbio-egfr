I'm participating in a protein design competition and need assistance designing new amino acid sequences. Can you help with that?
Yes! I'd be happy to help with protein design. I can assist with:
Sequence generation: Suggesting novel amino acid sequences based on a given structure or function.
Sequence optimization: Improving existing sequences for stability, binding affinity, or enzymatic activity.
Structural analysis: Providing insights into secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and other biophysical properties.
Please provide more details about the competition and your design goals, such as:
Target protein function (e.g., enzyme, binding protein, therapeutic)
Desired properties (e.g., increased stability, specificity, activity)
Any constraints (e.g., sequence length, specific residues)
Reference structures (e.g., PDB IDs)
The more information you share, the better I can assist you in designing innovative amino acid sequences!
My goal is to design a binding protein to the extracellular domain of EGFR, a cancer-associated drug target. What are some known antibody-based inhitibors of EGFR, such as Cetuximab?
Excellent goal! EGFR is a well-established target for cancer therapy. Here are some known antibody-based inhibitors of EGFR:
Cetuximab (Erbitux): A chimeric monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR ligand binding, approved for colorectal, head and neck, and lung cancers.
Panitumumab (Vectibix): A fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits EGFR ligand binding, approved for colorectal cancer.
Necitumumab (Portrazza): A fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR ligand binding, approved for squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Zalutumumab: A fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits EGFR ligand binding, investigated in clinical trials for head and neck, and lung cancers.
These antibodies primarily bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR, specifically:
Domain III: Cetuximab and panitumumab bind to this domain, blocking ligand binding and receptor activation.
Domain I and II: Necitumumab binds to these domains, also preventing ligand binding.
When designing your binding protein, consider:
Epitope mapping: Identify specific regions on EGFR's extracellular domain for binding.
Binding affinity: Optimize your design for high affinity and specificity.
Structural stability: Ensure your protein maintains stability and functionality.
You can use online resources like:
Protein Data Bank (PDB): Explore EGFR structures and antibody-EGFR complexes (e.g., 1YY9, 3BZW).
UniProt: Access EGFR sequence and functional information.
Feel free to share your design progress or ask specific questions, and I'll be happy to assist you further!
Great, our strategy is going to be to design a new antibody-based inhibitor based on the sequences of those four existing inhibitors. I'll provide the heavy and light chain sequences in FASTA format. You should please provide an antibody amino acid sequence for the contest. The contest rules are:
• Only natural amino acids
• Max 200 amino acids in length
• Single chain
• At least 10 amino acid edit distance from known binders

That's perfect, you have the design strategy down. This will be submission 1. Let's generate submission 2 and make sure it is not too similar to submission 1.
Excellent! I'm glad the first design met your expectations.
For Submission 2, I'll employ a different strategy to ensure diversity:
Swap and combine: Interchange elements from different inhibitors, creating a new sequence.
Mutate and optimize: Introduce targeted mutations to improve binding affinity and specificity.
Insert and delete: Add or remove residues to modify the binding interface.
Here's Submission 2:
